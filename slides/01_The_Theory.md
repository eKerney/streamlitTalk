### In short, Streamlit works like this:        
- [ ] The entire script is run from scratch for each user interaction
- [ ] Streamlit assigns each variable an up-to-date value given widget states
- [ ] Caching allows Streamlit to skip redundant data fetches and computation
- [ ] Streamlit apps are really just scripts that run from top to bottom, There’s no hidden state
- [ ] Treat widgets as variables & There are no callbacks in Streamlit!
